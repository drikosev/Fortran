Fortran parser Issues

[ 2015-01-05 ] The derived-type-def didn't accept labels in type-bound-proc-bindings and a few semicolons were missing (todo: test).
[ 2015-01-28 ] The "ONLY" keyword was undefined and the comma was omitted in "only-list".
[ 2015-03-03 ] Added the end-critical-stmt.
[ 2015-04-22 ] The parser rejected functions as lvalues, which are likely valid.
[ 2017-04-10 ] Removed the rule "ac-implied-do-object ::= keyword = expr". Added an accurate "ac-implied-do-cntrl" .
[ 2017-05-01 ] The ERSP Extension was found to be buggy. So far cannot reproduce the bug in a small grammar (todo: handle this open issue).
[ 2017-05-03 ] touched name-f & removed name-r from lprocedure names and run all the tests in generated parser ( todo: test also in simulator my test cases)
[ 2017-05-06 ] Extended the grammar with the newer assumed-rank-spec as an option to array-spec (seems an overkill to run again the tests).
[ 2017-07-07 ] The rule part-name-p-section-subscript-list-l didn't allow a follow "%" after an p-actual-arg-spec-list-l. 
               In addition the part-name-p-section-subscript-list didn't a follow "=" that might be proved too restrictive for future requirements.
[ 2017-07-07 ] A awkward name rule "actual-arg-low-priority" has been replaced by "actual-arg".
[ 2017-07-08 ] The "do-block" should be optional in a "block-do-construct".
[ 2018-04-16 ] Segmentation fault on an extra comma in a type declaration stmt (ie: "real, x").
[ 2018-04-19 ] Found an undefined <-name> instead of a <name> in <suffix> (after a <language-bindic-spec>).
[ 2018-04-21 ] Extension: Allow old style initialisation without double colon (ie: "real pi / 3.14159 /")
[ 2018-04-21 ] Extension: Allow Dec style length specification "real x*8 (2)" (in addition to "real x(2) * 8").
[ 2018-04-23 ] Extension: <cray-pointer-stmt>. 



Fortran scanner Issues

[ 2017-05-03 ] I'd predicted only array context after "call*" and the scanner was returning a name-l on "call r('s')" (todo: confirm not_cons_keys ).
[ 2018-04-19 ] A scalar-int-constant-name may have underscores (ie: c_char_"kernel32.dll").



Legacy parser Issues
[ 2018-04-22 ] Support for VAX/DEC structures, unions, maps, and records. 
[ 2018-04-23 ] The keyword "RECORD" wasn't acceptable in the interface of a PROCEDURE declaration stmt (Fortran 2003).  (done).
[ 2018-04-23 ] The Dec specific <parameter-stmt> isn't supported in fixed form (ie PARAMETER y = 1 is interpreted as PARAMETERy= 1).
[ 2018-04-23 ] Extension: <cray-pointer-stmt>.
